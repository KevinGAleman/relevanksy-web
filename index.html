              &nbsp;&nbsp;this question has no simple answer, and it is sparking conversation in many circles around
              the world, whether it be the billionaires in Elon Musk’s inner circle, the degens of the crypto
              community, or the art gallery owners in Paris and New York City.
              <br />
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;what we do know is that
              relevanksy has arrived, and he’s working on building a new vision for artists in the crypto space. a
              vision where they’re able to release their art to the world in an entirely new and more intimate way.
              and he’s going to be utilizing this platform to launch his first series of culturally relevant,
              satirical, and rare NFTs: <u>the relevanksy collection</u>
              <br />
              <br />
              <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;it’s time to do something different.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;the core token of the relevanksy dApp is $RSY, and <u>the relevanksy collection</u> will be the first
              NFT collection offered via the app.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;the relevanksy dApp aims to provide a new
              experience for artists looking to drop an expanding collection of rare, one-off NFTs. artists will have
              the opportunity to set up raffles for their NFT projects, where raffle tickets can be purchased with $RSY
              for an opportunity to win exclusive rights to mint the new NFT.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;the pilot program
              for the relevanksy app will be <u>the relevanksy collection</u>, a series that aims to provide social commentary,
              satirical memes, and a historical timeline of crypto and world events as seen from the eyes of relevanksy
              himself.

              &nbsp;&nbsp;$RSY has a unique and dynamic set of tokenomics. the buy and sell taxes are independently
              adjustable, but cannot exceed 12 percent. the breakdown of this 12 percent for both buy and sell at launch
              is as follows:<br />2% dev (which can never exceed 2%)<br />5% marketing<br />5% liquidity<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;the
              dynamic and adjustable buy and sell tax will allow for many unique use cases, like focusing on the
              liquidity pool when building the floor, or focusing on marketing in times of volatility, or special
              promotions like a 0% buy tax happy hour.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;the long term vision for this project is
              to turn the buy and sell taxes down to 0%, and to allow for the revenue from the platform to sustain the
              funding for the project.
